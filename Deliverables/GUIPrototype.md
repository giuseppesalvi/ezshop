\<Report here the GUI that you propose. You are free to organize it as you prefer. A suggested presentation matches the Use cases and scenarios defined in the Requirement document. The GUI can be shown as a sequence of graphical files (jpg, png)  >

The GUI is showed inside a pdf file in this repository called: "GUIPrototype.pdf" [here](./GUIPrototype.pdf)
For a better experience download that file, so the buttons and the links between different wireframes work.
