# Stories and personas

George, 55, is the manager of a small clothing shop. He has described his needs here in a couple of sentences.

I want the software to manage the sales. Adding items to the sale with the barcode reader or manually, this part should be fast and without delay. Then customer should be able to pay with cash or credit card. I need an accounting section to see all the sales and expenses during a specific period. I need to check my income each month, and it should be accurate.

I want to add items to the system, categorize them, and check the number of items currently in the shop. The shop should be connected to the inventory and update the number of items when necessary. I want the ability to generate reports on the items in the inventory. I need to add the suppliers and see the list of suppliers that can provide a spcific item.

I want to save customerâ€™s contact info for managing customers and notify them about future discounts later. If the customer wants to have a fidelity card, the software should register a card for them. The software also should notify the registered customers about discounts through email.
