# Essential description

Small shops require a simple application to support the owner or manager. A small shop (ex a food shop) occupies 50-200 square meters, sells 500-2000 different item types, has one or a few cash registers 
EZShop is a software application to:
* manage sales
* manage inventory
* manage customers
* support accounting


# Stakeholders


| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Manager     |  Is the owner of the shop and the administrator of the system           | 
| Cashier | Interact with customers, manages the inventory |
| Customer | Buys products, can have a fidelity card |
| Supplier | Provides products to the shop |
| PoS | The physical Point of Sale terminal |
| Barcode reader |  Optical scanner that can read printed barcodes |
| Gmail gateway | Mail service to send mails to customers|

# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Context Diagram
\<Define here Context diagram using UML use case diagram>

```plantuml
actor Manager as a
actor Cashier as o
actor User as u
actor Pos as p
actor "Barcode reader" as b
actor "Gmail gateway" as g
a -up-|> u
o -up-|> u
(EZShop) <-left- u
(EZShop) <-- p
(EZShop) <-- b
(EZShop) <-right- g
```

\<actors are a subset of stakeholders>

## Interfaces
\<describe here each interface in the context diagram>
\<GUIs will be described graphically in a separate document>
| Actor | Logical Interface | Physical Interface  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|   The Manager     | GUI | Desktop |
|   The Cashier     | GUI | Desktop |
|	The PoS		| API ... 	| Ethernet cable|
|	The Barcode reader | API ... | USB connector type A | 
|   The Gmail gateway | Gmail API | Ethernet cable|

# Stories and personas
\<A Persona is a realistic impersonation of an actor. Define here a few personas and describe in plain text how a persona interacts with the system>

\<Persona is-an-instance-of actor>

\<stories will be formalized later as scenarios in use cases>

... I want to add items to the system and categorize them. I want to check the number of items that are currently in the shop. The shop should be connected to the inventory and update the number of items when it is necessary (for example selling something). I want the ability to generate reports on the items in the inventory. I want to add the suppliers as well and see the list of items that each supplier can provide.

... I want to save customerâ€™s contact info to inform them about future discounts. If the customer wants to have a fidelity card the store should register a card for them. The software also should notify the registered customers about discounts through Email and SMS.
