# Essential description

Small shops require a simple application to support the owner or manager. A small shop (ex a food shop) occupies 50-200 square meters, sells 500-2000 different item types, has one or a few cash registers 
EZShop is a software application to:
* manage sales
* manage inventory
* manage customers
* support accounting


# Stakeholders


| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Manager     |  Is the owner of the shop and the administrator of the system           | 
| Cashier | Interact with customers, manages the inventory |
| Customer | Buys products, can have a fidelity card |
| Supplier | Provides products to the shop |
| PoS | The physical Point of Sale terminal |
| Barcode reader |  Optical scanner that can read printed barcodes |
| Gmail gateway | Mail service to send mails to customers|

# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Context Diagram
\<Define here Context diagram using UML use case diagram>

```plantuml
actor Manager as a
actor Cashier as o
actor User as u
actor Pos as p
actor "Barcode reader" as b
actor "Gmail gateway" as g
a -up-|> u
o -up-|> u
u --> (EZShop)
p --> (EZShop)
b --> (EZShop)
g --> (EZShop)
```

\<actors are a subset of stakeholders>

## Interfaces
\<describe here each interface in the context diagram>
\<GUIs will be described graphically in a separate document>
| Actor | Logical Interface | Physical Interface  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|   The Manager     | GUI | Desktop |
|   The Cashier     | GUI | Desktop |
|	The PoS		| API ... 	| Ethernet cable|
|	The Barcode reader | API ... | USB connector type A | 
|   The Gmail gateway | Gmail API | Ethernet cable|

# Stories and personas
\<A Persona is a realistic impersonation of an actor. Define here a few personas and describe in plain text how a persona interacts with the system>

\<Persona is-an-instance-of actor>

\<stories will be formalized later as scenarios in use cases>

... I want to add items to the system and categorize them. I want to check the number of items that are currently in the shop. The shop should be connected to the inventory and update the number of items when it is necessary (for example selling something). I want the ability to generate reports on the items in the inventory. I want to add the suppliers as well and see the list of items that each supplier can provide.

... I want to save customerâ€™s contact info to inform them about future discounts. If the customer wants to have a fidelity card the store should register a card for them. The software also should notify the registered customers about discounts through Email and SMS.

# Use case diagram and use cases


## Use case diagram
\<define here UML Use case diagram UCD summarizing all use cases, and their relationships>


\<next describe here each use case in the UCD>
### Use case 1, UC1
| Actors Involved        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the UC can start> |  
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after UC is finished> |
|  Nominal Scenario     | \<Textual description of actions executed by the UC> |
|  Variants     | \<other executions, ex in case of errors> |

##### Scenario 1.1 

\<describe here scenarios instances of UC1>

\<a scenario is a sequence of steps that corresponds to a particular execution of one use case>

\<a scenario is a more formal description of a story>

\<only relevant scenarios should be described>

| Scenario 1.1 | |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the scenario can start> |
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after scenario is finished> |
| Step#        | Description  |
|  1     |  |  
|  2     |  |
|  ...     |  |

##### Scenario 1.2

##### Scenario 1.x

### Use case 2, UC2
..

### Use case x, UCx
..

### Use case 1, UC1 - Add customer
| Actors Involved        |  Cashier |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Customer X does not have a fidelity card |  
|  Post condition     | Customer info added in the system |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Customer X agrees to give us some personal information (name, surname, email), the cashier insert those information in the system, and attach to them a card ID, scanning with the barcode reader a new fidelity card |
|  Variants     | - |

### Use case 2, UC2 - Notify customers about discounts
| Actors Involved        |  Manager |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Customer list is not empty |  
|  Post condition     | Emails sent |
|  Nominal Scenario     | The manager wants to send an email to notify customers of a particular discount |
